## Overview

This is a Puppet module to manage a Beanstalkd instance.

## Module Description

The Beanstalkd module handles installing, configuring, and running the Beanstalkd daemon.

If you are running this on a rhel based distro you need to make sure you have the epel repository set up. We have not included this as a hard dependency but you can easily add it using the epel module provided by stahnma (https://forge.puppet.com/stahnma/epel).

## Setup

### What beanstalkd affects

* beanstalkd package
* beanstalkd configuration
* beanstalkd service

### Beginning with beanstalkd

`include 'beanstalkd'` is enough to get you up and running. If you'd like to
pass parameters, you can do something like this:

```puppet
class { 'beanstalkd':
  listen_addr      => '0.0.0.0',
  listen_port      => '11300',
  enable_binlog    => true,
  binlog_directory => '/var/lib/beanstalkd',
}
```
Or, you can use the same options in hiera:
```yaml
---
beanstalkd::listen_addr: '0.0.0.0'
beanstalkd::listen_port: '11300'
beanstalkd::enable_binlog: 'true'
beanstalkd::binlog_directory: '/var/lib/beanstalkd'
```
